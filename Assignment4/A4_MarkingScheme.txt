TA Name: 

NB: This scheme may change depending on the range of submissions received, but the outline of what is expected will be similar.
    The bullet points under each section are key considerations in grading, but do not necessarily have equal weighting.

Requirements: 
   - data loading function (all data is loaded only once); 
   - two learning functions (using different algorithms); 
   - two visualization functions (using different methods and data);
   - text or pdf (pdf preferred) containing the analysis/discussion of the results of the project, incorporating images as appropriate.


- Data Loading -

[2 marks]
   - data loaded only once
   - well-structured loading of the data

- Learning -

[8 marks = 4 marks/algorithm] 
   - learning method is implemented properly and works
   - appropriate method used to determine the validity of the learning results
   - time/effort was spent to explore different options/possibilities with a given algorithm (beyond what was done in class)

- Visualization -

[5 marks = 2.5 marks/visualization]
   - the visualizations present new information (not already known from the description or prior understanding of the data) or answer a definite question;
   - the visualizations are chosen well (display desired information clearly);
   - proper labels.

- Analysis -

[5 marks]
   - clear description of what is done in the learning and visualization tasks;
   - reasonable inferences made concerning what the learning methods show and what their limitations are;
   - comparison/contrast of different learning methods, as appropriate given the choices of algorithms made;
   - incorporate visualizations into the discussion of the project in an appropriate place, given choices of visualization methods.


- Deductions -

[-2 marks] code does not run without modification
[-2 marks] same algorithm is used for the two learning functions.
[-1.5 marks] same visualization method or the same data is used for the two visualization functions.
